	// consistency and uniqueness requirements described in the Desc
	// documentation.
	//
	// It is valid if one and the same Collector sends duplicate
	// descriptors. Those duplicates are simply ignored. However, two
	// different Collectors must not send duplicate descriptors.
	//
	// Sending no descriptor at all marks the Collector as “unchecked”,
	// i.e. no checks will be performed at registration time, and the
	// Collector may yield any Metric it sees fit in its Collect method.
	//
	// This method idempotently sends the same descriptors throughout the
	// lifetime of the Collector. It may be called concurrently and
	// therefore must be implemented in a concurrency safe way.
	//
	// If a Collector encounters an error while executing this method, it
	// must send an invalid descriptor (created with NewInvalidDesc) to
	// signal the error to the registry.

	// Collect is called by the Prometheus registry when collecting
	// metrics. The implementation sends each collected metric via the
	// provided channel and returns once the last metric has been sent. The
	// descriptor of each sent metric is one of those returned by Describe
	// (unless the Collector is unchecked, see above). Returned metrics that
	// share the same descriptor must differ in their variable label
	// values.
	//
	// This method may be called concurrently and must therefore be
	// implemented in a concurrency safe way. Blocking occurs at the expense
	// of total performance of rendering all registered metrics. Ideally,
	// Collector implementations support concurrent readers.
